## Introduction to WP Docker!

**WP Docker** makes WordPress development a breeze with its easy-to-use container platform that works right from your terminal.

Designed for both beginners and pros, it gives you everything you need to run WordPress smoothly:

- Currently supports OpenResty (NGINX with Lua), MariaDB, and PHP-FPM
- Smart resource management: Automatically configures PHP-FPM and MySQL based on your computer's capabilities
- Quick setup: Gets WordPress running with just a few commands
- Built-in caching tools: Automatically configures WordPress caching with ready-to-use setups for FastCGI Cache, Redis, WP Super Cache, WP Fastest Cache, and more
- WP-CLI ready: Run `wpdocker wp cli example.ltd <command>` to execute any WP-CLI command directly inside your container
- Enjoy flexible usage through a friendly terminal interface or the convenient `wpdocker` command line‚Äîwhichever works best for you!
- Safe and secure, as WP Docker uses only official Docker images that are regularly updated (except for OpenResty, which uses my custom-built image to support Brotli compression and the `ngx_cache_purge` module)

*Soon* you'll be able to switch between different web servers like OpenResty or Caddy without changing your workflow. This exciting feature is coming in a future update, with the system automatically handling all configuration changes for you.

WP Docker adopts infrastructure-as-code principles to give you complete freedom, so you're never locked into one provider. Your entire WordPress setup‚Äîincluding Linux, PHP, and database‚Äîruns in containers that you can move anywhere. In the near future, WP Docker will introduce a powerful migration feature that lets you transfer your complete setup to a different server quickly and automatically‚Äîgiving you true portability and freedom to host your WordPress sites wherever you want!

As an open-source project released under the MIT license, you're free to use, modify, and distribute WP Docker for any purpose, whether personal or commercial.

Built to be **simple, friendly, and flexible**, WP Docker works perfectly on both **Mac and Linux** computers. Why not give it a try?

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- It is recommended to have Docker and the Docker Compose plugin installed before install WP Docker
- Git (for installation and updates)
- Bash 3.0+ (pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS), but Bash 4.0 or later is recommended.
- At least 1GB of RAM per WordPress site (recommended)

### macOS-Specific Requirements

Docker on macOS **cannot access folders outside** the shared file system list.

After installation, you **must add `/opt`** to Docker ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí File Sharing:

[Docker File Sharing Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#file-sharing)

---

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thachpn165/wp-docker/refs/heads/main/src/install.sh -o install.sh && bash -i install.sh
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
wpdocker menu
```

This command opens the interactive terminal menu for managing your WordPress sites.

You can also use WP Docker through the `wpdocker` command. For more information, refer to the instructions with the `wpdocker --help` command.

## Latest Release - v1.2.0-beta

Release date: 2025-04-16

### üöÄ Added

- New command: `wpdocker core uninstall` for full removal flow
- Centralized MariaDB container with dynamic database/user creation

- Auto-tracking of cache type into `.config.json`
- Resource-aware PHP-FPM tuning: `pm.max_children`, server tier detection
- Shared FastCGI cache volume across PHP and NGINX containers
- Added slowlog + timeout settings into `php-fpm.conf`

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

- Moved system-level scripts into `shared/core/` structure
- Removed `db_utils.sh` and legacy per-site DB containers
