## Introduction

**WP Docker** is a specialized containerization platform designed for WordPress environments, offering an intuitive, terminal-based interface for developers and system administrators.

This enterprise-grade toolkit provides a security-hardened, performance-optimized infrastructure with key features such as:
- Automated WordPress provisioning
- SSL certificate management (including Let's Encrypt and custom certs)
- Modular backup orchestration with local and cloud (Rclone) support
- Full WP-CLI integration
- Seamless cloud synchronization

The platform adopts a modular architecture supporting interchangeable web servers such as OpenResty (NGINX + Lua), Caddy Server, and OpenLiteSpeed. This flexibility allows seamless switching between stacks with automatic configuration adaptation.

Unlike conventional WordPress setups, WP Docker embraces infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles to eliminate vendor lock-in. Its isolated containerized environment‚Äîcombining Linux, PHP, and database services‚Äîensures maximum portability, scalability, and operational consistency.

By simplifying multi-stage environment replication (dev ‚Üí staging ‚Üí prod), WP Docker enhances security posture, accelerates deployment workflows, and ensures consistent performance across different infrastructures.


Crafted with **simplicity, user-friendliness, and extensibility** at its core, this solution runs seamlessly on both **macOS and Linux** environments.

## Latest Release - v1.1.3-beta

- **Advanced Backup Restoration**: Enhanced functionality supporting both files and database restoration
- **Improved Menu Integration**: Streamlined access to restoration tools through the system menu
- **Test Mode Support**: Enhanced simulation capabilities for backup and restore processes
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Refined debug output for monitoring key operations

### Fixed

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (for installation and updates)
- Bash 4.0+ (pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS)
- At least 1GB of RAM per WordPress site (recommended)

### macOS-Specific Requirements

Docker on macOS **cannot mount any folder** outside of the shared file system list.

After installation, you **must add `/opt`** to Docker ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí File Sharing:

[Docker File Sharing Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#file-sharing)

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://github.com/thachpn165/wp-docker/blob/main/src/install.sh | bash
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
wpdocker
```

This command opens the interactive terminal menu for managing your WordPress sites.

## Key Features

### WordPress Site Management
- Create and manage multiple WordPress installations simultaneously
- Configure independent PHP versions for individual sites
- Implement multilingual and multisite configurations

### Security Features
- Automatic SSL certificate deployment (Let's Encrypt, custom, or self-signed)
- Isolated container environments for enhanced security
- Advanced firewall configurations through NGINX

### Backup and Recovery
- Execute comprehensive backup solutions with cloud integration (via Rclone)
- Schedule automated periodic backups through cron functionality
- Restore sites from previous backup points with file and database recovery

### Configuration and Monitoring
- Directly modify configuration files including `php.ini` and `php-fpm.conf`
- Monitor site health through SSL verification and log analysis
- Performance optimization tools for NGINX and PHP-FPM

### System Administration
- Perform complete site removal including containers, files, and SSL certificates
- Update Docker images and system components
- Access container shells for advanced troubleshooting

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced users requiring custom configurations, the following files can be modified:

- `config/nginx/`: NGINX configuration templates
- `config/php/`: PHP version-specific configurations
- `config/mysql/`: MySQL server settings

After modifying configuration files, restart the affected services through the system menu.
