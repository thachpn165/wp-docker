## Introduction

**WP Docker** is a specialized containerization platform designed for WordPress environments, offering an intuitive, terminal-based interface for developers and system administrators.

This enterprise-grade toolkit provides a security-hardened, performance-optimized infrastructure with key features such as:

- Auto-calculate PHP-FPM and MySQL configurations based on host resources (CPU, RAM)
- Automated WordPress provisioning
- Automated WordPress cache provisioning in NGINX (and other web servers later), currently supporting configurations for FastCGI Cache, Redis, WP Super Cache, W3 Total Cache, and WP Fastest Cache
- SSL certificate management (including Let's Encrypt and custom certs)
- Modular backup orchestration with local and cloud (Rclone) support
- Full WP-CLI integration
- Seamless cloud synchronization

The platform adopts a modular architecture supporting interchangeable web servers such as OpenResty (NGINX + Lua), Caddy Server (coming soon), and OpenLiteSpeed. This flexibility allows seamless switching between stacks with automatic configuration adaptation.

Unlike conventional WordPress setups, WP Docker embraces infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles to eliminate vendor lock-in. Its isolated containerized environment‚Äîcombining Linux, PHP, and database services‚Äîensures maximum portability, scalability, and operational consistency.


Crafted with **simplicity, user-friendliness, and extensibility** at its core, this solution runs seamlessly on both **macOS and Linux** environments.

## Latest Release - v1.1.9-beta

Release date: 2025-04-16

### üöÄ Added

- New command: `wpdocker core uninstall` for full removal flow
- Centralized MariaDB container with dynamic database/user creation
- Slowlog file: `logs/php_slow.log` per site (linked via `php-fpm.conf`)
- PHP error log: `logs/php_error.log` with dynamic injection into `php.ini`
- Auto-tracking of cache type into `.config.json`
- Resource-aware PHP-FPM tuning: `pm.max_children`, server tier detection
- Shared FastCGI cache volume across PHP and NGINX containers
- Added slowlog + timeout settings into `php-fpm.conf`

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

- Moved system-level scripts into `shared/core/` structure
- Removed `db_utils.sh` and legacy per-site DB containers
- Changed default `$DOCKER_NETWORK` to `wpdocker-network`
- All docker-compose files now use `${docker_network}` instead of hardcoded names

### üêû Fixed

- Ensured MySQL volume and container names are consistent across installs
- Fixed error when writing `php.ini` and `php-fpm.conf` when paths are missing
- Made uninstall script safely ignore `.git/` and preserve archives

*For complete changelog history, please see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)*

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (for installation and updates)
- Bash 3.0+ (pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS), but Bash 4.0 or later is recommended.
- At least 1GB of RAM per WordPress site (recommended)

### macOS-Specific Requirements

Docker on macOS **cannot mount any folder** outside of the shared file system list.

After installation, you **must add `/opt`** to Docker ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí File Sharing:

[Docker File Sharing Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#file-sharing)

---

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thachpn165/wp-docker/refs/heads/main/src/install.sh -o install.sh && bash -i install.sh
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
wpdocker
```

This command opens the interactive terminal menu for managing your WordPress sites.

## Key Features

### WordPress Site Management

- Create and manage multiple WordPress installations simultaneously
- Configure independent PHP versions for individual sites
- Restore WordPress source code and database from backup interactively

### Security Features

- Automatic SSL certificate deployment (Let's Encrypt, custom, or self-signed)
- Isolated container environments for enhanced security
- Advanced firewall configurations through NGINX

### Backup and Recovery

- Execute comprehensive backup solutions with cloud integration (via Rclone)
- Schedule automated periodic backups through cron functionality
- Human-readable cron schedule descriptions when setting backups
- Restore sites from previous backup points with file and database recovery

### Configuration and Monitoring

- Directly modify configuration files including `php.ini` and `php-fpm.conf`
- Monitor site health through SSL verification and log analysis
- Performance optimization tools for NGINX and PHP-FPM
- **Switch system language dynamically from the System Tools menu**
- **Full multilingual support (i18n) for CLI prompts and messages**

### System Administration

- Perform complete site removal including containers, files, and SSL certificates
- Update Docker images and system components
- Access container shells for advanced troubleshooting
- Enable global Debug Mode to show internal commands and logs
- Enable Dev Mode to preview unreleased or under-development features

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced users requiring custom configurations, the following files can be modified:

- `config/nginx/`: NGINX configuration templates
- `config/php/`: PHP version-specific configurations
- `config/mysql/`: MySQL server settings

After modifying configuration files, restart the affected services through the system menu.
