## Introduction

**WP Docker** is a specialized containerization platform designed for WordPress environments, offering an intuitive, terminal-based interface for developers and system administrators.

This enterprise-grade toolkit provides a security-hardened, performance-optimized infrastructure with key features such as:
- Automated WordPress provisioning
- SSL certificate management (including Let's Encrypt and custom certs)
- Modular backup orchestration with local and cloud (Rclone) support
- Full WP-CLI integration
- Seamless cloud synchronization

The platform adopts a modular architecture supporting interchangeable web servers such as OpenResty (NGINX + Lua), Caddy Server, and OpenLiteSpeed. This flexibility allows seamless switching between stacks with automatic configuration adaptation.

Unlike conventional WordPress setups, WP Docker embraces infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles to eliminate vendor lock-in. Its isolated containerized environment‚Äîcombining Linux, PHP, and database services‚Äîensures maximum portability, scalability, and operational consistency.


Crafted with **simplicity, user-friendliness, and extensibility** at its core, this solution runs seamlessly on both **macOS and Linux** environments.

## Latest Release - v1.1.8-beta
Release date: 2025-04-14

### üöÄ Added

- **Improved performance on startup and CLI commands**
  - `wpdocker` now uses `source main.sh` instead of `bash main.sh` to avoid spawning sub-shells.
  - `start_docker_if_needed` uses `docker info` instead of `docker stats` for better compatibility and speed.

- **Configuration enhancements**
  - Automatically enforces `DEBUG_MODE="false"` in `config.sh` during GitHub workflows (`dev-build.yml`, `release.yml`).

- **New i18n variables added**
  - Introduced many new `readonly` variables to support multilingual CLI prompts and logs.
  - Full list of added i18n variables included in checklist.

- **Backup & restore improvements**
  - Prompt-based logic for restoring source code and database independently.
  - Shows backup file list with timestamps before prompting for selection.
  - Validates file paths and handles relative/absolute path automatically.

- **Code architecture improvements**
  - Replaced all old `menu` files under `$FUNCTIONS_DIR/<feature>` with `prompt` functions following naming convention: `<feature>_prompt_<action>`.
  - All CLI files now interact with prompt functions inside logic files for better structure and testability.

- **Safe `load_config_file` loading**
  - Added `if declare -F load_config_file` check to prevent duplicate loading during nested sourcing.

### üêû Fixed

- Fixed `start_docker_if_needed` delay and fallback on macOS when Docker Desktop is slow to boot.
- Fixed potential issues when selecting storage for cloud backup (ensures correct format, skips invalid index).
- Fixed backup auto-delete not skipping `.git` or special folders.
Improved detection of domain directory and backups for edge cases.

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

- Simplified and optimized CLI wrappers across all features (backup, database, PHP, SSL, system, website).
- All CLI scripts use unified `SCRIPT_PATH` + `safe_source` pattern and validate required params.
Updated backup logic to:
  - Automatically delete backup files after successful cloud upload.
  - Fallback to local backup if cloud storage is invalid or not selected.
Refactored entire prompt system to move user-interactive logic into `prompt_*` functions instead of `menu.sh`.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (for installation and updates)
- Bash 4.0+ (pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS)
- At least 1GB of RAM per WordPress site (recommended)

### macOS-Specific Requirements

Docker on macOS **cannot mount any folder** outside of the shared file system list.

After installation, you **must add `/opt`** to Docker ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí File Sharing:

[Docker File Sharing Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#file-sharing)

---

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thachpn165/wp-docker/refs/heads/main/src/install.sh -o install.sh && bash -i install.sh
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
wpdocker
```

This command opens the interactive terminal menu for managing your WordPress sites.

## Key Features

### WordPress Site Management
- Create and manage multiple WordPress installations simultaneously
- Configure independent PHP versions for individual sites
- Restore WordPress source code and database from backup interactively

### Security Features
- Automatic SSL certificate deployment (Let's Encrypt, custom, or self-signed)
- Isolated container environments for enhanced security
- Advanced firewall configurations through NGINX

### Backup and Recovery
- Execute comprehensive backup solutions with cloud integration (via Rclone)
- Schedule automated periodic backups through cron functionality
- Human-readable cron schedule descriptions when setting backups
- Restore sites from previous backup points with file and database recovery

### Configuration and Monitoring
- Directly modify configuration files including `php.ini` and `php-fpm.conf`
- Monitor site health through SSL verification and log analysis
- Performance optimization tools for NGINX and PHP-FPM
- **Switch system language dynamically from the System Tools menu**
- **Full multilingual support (i18n) for CLI prompts and messages**

### System Administration
- Perform complete site removal including containers, files, and SSL certificates
- Update Docker images and system components
- Access container shells for advanced troubleshooting
- Enable global Debug Mode to show internal commands and logs
- Enable Dev Mode to preview unreleased or under-development features

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced users requiring custom configurations, the following files can be modified:

- `config/nginx/`: NGINX configuration templates
- `config/php/`: PHP version-specific configurations
- `config/mysql/`: MySQL server settings

After modifying configuration files, restart the affected services through the system menu.
