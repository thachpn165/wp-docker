## Introduction

**WP Docker** is a specialized containerization platform designed for WordPress environments, offering an intuitive, terminal-based interface for developers and system administrators.

This enterprise-grade toolkit provides a security-hardened, performance-optimized infrastructure with key features such as:
- Automated WordPress provisioning
- SSL certificate management (including Let's Encrypt and custom certs)
- Modular backup orchestration with local and cloud (Rclone) support
- Full WP-CLI integration
- Seamless cloud synchronization

The platform adopts a modular architecture supporting interchangeable web servers such as OpenResty (NGINX + Lua), Caddy Server, and OpenLiteSpeed. This flexibility allows seamless switching between stacks with automatic configuration adaptation.

Unlike conventional WordPress setups, WP Docker embraces infrastructure-as-code (IaC) principles to eliminate vendor lock-in. Its isolated containerized environment‚Äîcombining Linux, PHP, and database services‚Äîensures maximum portability, scalability, and operational consistency.


Crafted with **simplicity, user-friendliness, and extensibility** at its core, this solution runs seamlessly on both **macOS and Linux** environments.

## Latest Release - v1.1.7-beta
Release date: 2025-04-07
### üöÄ Added

- Integrated i18n (multi-language) system across the project:
  - All CLI messages are managed in centralized files: `shared/lang/vi.sh` and `en.sh`.
  - `LANG_CODE` defined in `.env` allows dynamic language switching.
- New language switch feature (`core_change_lang_logic`) in System Tools menu.
- Integrated global `DEBUG_MODE` and `DEV_MODE`:
  - `DEBUG_MODE=true`: displays full log and commands being executed.
  - `DEV_MODE=true`: shows under-development features.
- Added `print_msg`, `print_and_debug`, and `debug_log` for unified CLI output.
- New feature: Restore website from backup (`backup_restore_web_menu.sh`), with support for selecting `.tar.gz` and `.sql` files.
- Enhanced cron job summary with readable format using `cron_translate()`.
- The `core_change_lang_logic` now dynamically loads supported languages from `LANG_LIST`.
- Updated GitHub Actions `dev-build.yml` to automatically generate `nightly` release.

---

### üêû Fixed

- Fixed issue where `run_cmd` silently failed when `DEBUG_MODE=false` (added `eval` fallback).
- Resolved incorrect detection of relative backup file paths during restore.
- Fixed conflict in GitHub Actions builds caused by concurrent edits to `latest_version_dev.txt`.
- Resolved MySQL error caused by invalid `mysql < db_name` syntax.

---

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Changed

- All scripts in `menu/` and `cli/` have been refactored:
  - Replaced all `read -p` with `get_input_or_test_value` for test compatibility.
  - Standardized `PROJECT_DIR` detection and sourcing `load_config.sh`.
- All CLI display logic switched to `print_msg` with i18n support.
- Refactored path resolution to ensure backup file paths are absolute.
- Fully refactored all `wordpress_*` logic scripts to adopt i18n/debug/dev standards.
- All inline CLI messages have been moved to language files (i18n) to eliminate hardcoded text.

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Git (for installation and updates)
- Bash 4.0+ (pre-installed on most Linux distributions and macOS)
- At least 1GB of RAM per WordPress site (recommended)

### macOS-Specific Requirements

Docker on macOS **cannot mount any folder** outside of the shared file system list.

After installation, you **must add `/opt`** to Docker ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Resources ‚Üí File Sharing:

[Docker File Sharing Documentation](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/settings/mac/#file-sharing)

---

## Installation

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thachpn165/wp-docker/refs/heads/main/src/install.sh -o install.sh && bash -i install.sh
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run:

```bash
wpdocker
```

This command opens the interactive terminal menu for managing your WordPress sites.

## Key Features

### WordPress Site Management
- Create and manage multiple WordPress installations simultaneously
- Configure independent PHP versions for individual sites
- Restore WordPress source code and database from backup interactively

### Security Features
- Automatic SSL certificate deployment (Let's Encrypt, custom, or self-signed)
- Isolated container environments for enhanced security
- Advanced firewall configurations through NGINX

### Backup and Recovery
- Execute comprehensive backup solutions with cloud integration (via Rclone)
- Schedule automated periodic backups through cron functionality
- Human-readable cron schedule descriptions when setting backups
- Restore sites from previous backup points with file and database recovery

### Configuration and Monitoring
- Directly modify configuration files including `php.ini` and `php-fpm.conf`
- Monitor site health through SSL verification and log analysis
- Performance optimization tools for NGINX and PHP-FPM
- **Switch system language dynamically from the System Tools menu**
- **Full multilingual support (i18n) for CLI prompts and messages**

### System Administration
- Perform complete site removal including containers, files, and SSL certificates
- Update Docker images and system components
- Access container shells for advanced troubleshooting
- Enable global Debug Mode to show internal commands and logs
- Enable Dev Mode to preview unreleased or under-development features

## Advanced Configuration

For advanced users requiring custom configurations, the following files can be modified:

- `config/nginx/`: NGINX configuration templates
- `config/php/`: PHP version-specific configurations
- `config/mysql/`: MySQL server settings

After modifying configuration files, restart the affected services through the system menu.
