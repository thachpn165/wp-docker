# This script is used to restart a WordPress website managed by Docker Compose.
# It ensures the script is run in a Bash shell, determines the project directory,
# loads necessary configuration files, and restarts the specified website's containers.
#
# Usage:
#   ./website_restart.sh --domain=SITE_DOMAIN
#
# Arguments:
#   --domain=SITE_DOMAIN   (Required) The name of the WordPress site to restart.
#
# Script Workflow:
# 1. Verifies that the script is executed in a Bash shell.
# 2. Determines the PROJECT_DIR by locating the 'config.sh' file in the directory structure.
# 3. Loads the configuration file and required functions.
# 4. Parses the --domain argument to identify the target site.
# 5. Stops and removes the Docker containers associated with the specified site.
# 6. Restarts the Docker containers for the specified site.
#
# Exit Codes:
#   1 - General error (e.g., missing Bash shell, PROJECT_DIR not found, or missing config file).
#   2 - Missing or invalid --domain argument.
#   3 - Docker Compose operations (down/up) failed.
#
# Prerequisites:
# - Docker and Docker Compose must be installed and configured.
# - The PROJECT_DIR/shared/config/config.sh file must exist and be properly configured.
# - The SITES_DIR must contain a subdirectory for the specified site with a valid docker-compose.yml file.
#
# Example:
#   ./website_restart.sh --domain=my_wordpress_site
#
# Notes:
# - Ensure the script has executable permissions: chmod +x website_restart.sh
# - Run the script from a terminal with appropriate permissions.
