## [v1.1.3-beta] - 2025-03-29

### üêû Bug Fixes

- ${CHECKMARK} **Fixed infinite loop when loading `config.sh` in `backup_runner.sh`**
  - Previously, the script searched for `config.sh` by manually traversing directories (`../`), leading to an infinite loop if the file wasn't found.
  - Replaced with **smarter automatic detection of `PROJECT_DIR`**, using `realpath` and `dirname` to identify the project root directory.
  - This solution:
    - Prevents hanging issues when running via `cronjob`.
    - Ensures stable operation whether `backup_runner.sh` is called directly from shell or invoked from another script.
    - Works properly in both production and test environments (`bats`).

### ‚ôªÔ∏è Refactor

- ‚ôªÔ∏è Moved the common `config.sh` lookup logic to the beginning of the `backup_runner.sh` script, supporting reuse for other scripts if needed.
- ${CHECKMARK} Added support for `TEST_MODE` and `TEST_LOG_FILE` variables to prevent test logs from overwriting production logs.
